  <p data-test-bidi="" dir="ltr">This is an app specifically designed to connect Mindvalley all access members together to get to know one another, share life experiences &amp; reviews, see upcoming events, and create gatherings or virtual events. It‚Äôs kind of like linkedin, IG &amp; FB all in one; but with only a overloading amount of acceptance &amp; understanding. üòäüôè</p>
<p data-test-bidi="" dir="ltr">A fantastic way to make new friends within the community who share similar beliefs, who also question the bs rules of the world cultures, who are open-minded and share a passion to make positive impact in the world.</p>
<p data-test-bidi="" dir="ltr">I am so grateful for the positive changes Mindvalley is creating for this world. ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

  <p data-test-bidi="" dir="ltr">Simply put, Mindvalley is the future. As with Rome, Mindvalley was not built in a day. This app is still in its early stages, but you can already foresee where it is headed, and how far ahead of the pack it already is, thanks to the innovative minds at work.</p>
<p data-test-bidi="" dir="ltr">I love that you can search for people by location or career/hobbies, and create your OWN events. The Connections app will undoubtedly be HUGE in the future‚Äî especially considering the fact that Mindvalley All Access is a minuscule payment in comparison to colleges, plus a thousand other things I could go on about.</p>
