It would be nice to filter what I want to see and who because there are so many events, that is a large part of the feed. It is still fantastic to get to know the stories of such incredible people. Also, they need a larger character limit or limitless when making posts of commenting. The notification process can be improved but I am sure they are fixing that now. And I love how we can search for pictures in the app.</p><div><p class="AJTPZc">21 people found this review helpful</p><footer class="Anb3we"><p class="NC0Ppb">Did you find this helpful?</p></footer></div></div><div class="EGFGHd"><header class="c1bOId"><div class="YNR7H"><div class="gSGphe"><img src="https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a-/AD5-WCmDvGdA3MLF8ib1dTCn6QTq2-qZKMkog6pj2z89rA=s32-rw" srcset="https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a-/AD5-WCmDvGdA3MLF8ib1dTCn6QTq2-qZKMkog6pj2z89rA=s64-rw 2x" class="T75of abYEib"><p class="X5PpBb">Aleksander Johnson</p></div><div><div class="VfPpkd-xl07Ob-XxIAqe-OWXEXe-oYxtQd"></div></div></div></header><p class="h3YV2d">It is an amazing platform for Mindvalley students. The sense of community and wellbeing is amazing. They are also very supportive when it comes to anyone going through a rough time. For anyone following Mindvalley, taking courses. I highly suggest you use this app. Finding a peer group is so easy as well. I have recently made a new peer group of over 20 people, and we keep growing. The aesthetic design, and the cool function for allowing you to find people with different search parameters. &#x1F606;</p><div><p class="AJTPZc">11 people found this review helpful</p><footer class="Anb3we"><p class="NC0Ppb">Did you find this helpful?</p></footer></div></div><div class="EGFGHd"><header class="c1bOId"><div class="YNR7H"><div class="gSGphe"><img src="https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a/AEdFTp6xaSFvbhncPggU9ITSqxrxaPi2Wd5kEBtRdZi3=s32-rw-mo" srcset="https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a/AEdFTp6xaSFvbhncPggU9ITSqxrxaPi2Wd5kEBtRdZi3=s64-rw-mo 2x" class="T75of abYEib"><p class="X5PpBb">Kate Knight</p></div><div><div class="VfPpkd-xl07Ob-XxIAqe-OWXEXe-oYxtQd"><div> <p class="VfPpkd-xl07Ob-XxIAqe" id="UM33ifi16"><ul class="VfPpkd-StrnGf-rymPhb DMZ54e"><span class="VfPpkd-BFbNVe-bF1uUb NZp2ef"></span><li class="bO7Z3c VfPpkd-StrnGf-rymPhb-ibnC6b"><span class="VfPpkd-StrnGf-rymPhb-pZXsl"></span><span class="VfPpkd-StrnGf-rymPhb-b9t22c">Flag inappropriate</span></li><li class="bO7Z3c VfPpkd-StrnGf-rymPhb-ibnC6b"><span class="VfPpkd-StrnGf-rymPhb-pZXsl"></span><span class="VfPpkd-StrnGf-rymPhb-b9t22c">Show review history</span></li></ul></p></div></div></div></div></header><p class="h3YV2d">I have been a MV member for around 2 1/2 years and MV Pro for almost a year. This app worked very well. It was my means of connecting with international students until last week when I couldn&apos;t login even after changing my password 3 times. I would see HTTP 500 Internal Server Error flash on bottom of the screen and email and password not recognized by our system.</p><div><p class="AJTPZc">10 people found this review helpful</p><footer class="Anb3we"><p class="NC0Ppb">Did you find this helpful?</p></footer></div></div></div>
