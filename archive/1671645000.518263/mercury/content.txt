Toby ForstaterIt is great to connect with such amazing and caring people. It would be nice to filter what I want to see and who because there are so many events, that is a large part of the feed. It is still fantastic to get to know the stories of such incredible people. Also, they need a larger character limit or limitless when making posts of commenting. The notification process can be improved but I am sure they are fixing that now. And I love how we can search for pictures in the app.21 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?Aleksander JohnsonIt is an amazing platform for Mindvalley students. The sense of community and wellbeing is amazing. They are also very supportive when it comes to anyone going through a rough time. For anyone following Mindvalley, taking courses. I highly suggest you use this app. Finding a peer group is so easy as well. I have recently made a new peer group of over 20 people, and we keep growing. The aesthetic design, and the cool function for allowing you to find people with different search parameters. ðŸ˜†11 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?Kate Knight Flag inappropriateShow review historyI have been a MV member for around 2 1/2 years and MV Pro for almost a year. This app worked very well. It was my means of connecting with international students until last week when I couldn't login even after changing my password 3 times. I would see HTTP 500 Internal Server Error flash on bottom of the screen and email and password not recognized by our system.10 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?
