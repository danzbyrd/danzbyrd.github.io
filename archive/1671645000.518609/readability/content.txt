Mindvalley (http://www.mindvalley.com/about) is one of the world's largest online publishers in the personal growth industry. We're a close-knit team of 100+ (mostly) young, positive and passionate people from 32 countries with one big hairy goal: to touch 500 million lives by 2050.



We're the masterminds behind some of the most successful online products in the personal growth industry, including The Silva Method, Quantum Jumping and Chakra Healing. Among other things, Mindvalley is a creator of Omavana (http://www.omvana.com/) - one of the Top 20 Health and Fitness Apps in the USA Apple Store.



Our secret? A tantalizing cocktail of conscious marketing, bleeding-edge technology, game-changing ideas and a laser-sharp focus on learning and dreaming big.



Why do insanely smart people from around the world give up traditional job ideas and instead come and work for MindValley?



J-O-B is a dirty word. Work, we believe, needs to be fun, educational and something that makes you excited so much, that you jump out of bed each morning.



Screw the Traditional 9-5 Job. Instead, get paid to Play, Create, Learn and Grow. It’s like Being a Child Again. But with a Salary.



You'll be exposed to some of the best knowledge, people, and resources available anywhere - which you can apply to your own projects and become much more employable. Mindvalley is considered one of the top places in the world to work and has been written about in magazines, articles and on TV.
