<div class="content-lock-content"> <p>Since we started Mindvalley, we&#x2019;ve blossomed to over 100 employees and revenues past $15 million a year (50 million in Malaysian Ringgit).</p> <p>We&#x2019;ve become one of the biggest sellers of educational content online (mostly in&#xA0;<a href="http://www.mindvalleyacademy.com/">meditation and personal growth</a>,&#xA0;but we&#x2019;re expanding fast into other fields). We just hit 1.3 million subscribers and our 200,000th paying student.</p><p>Best of all, we&#x2019;ve done it all without ever having to take any funds or loans. Which means I currently still own 100 percent of my business.</p><p>It did not happen fast. Mindvalley took nine years to build. Some years were fun. Some years were brutal.</p><p>I started with $2,000, lost money in the first two months, became profitable in the third month and just kept reinvesting profits into the company.</p> <p>The upside is a company that is built around&#xA0;my passions &#x2013; meditation, personal growth, play, culture, travel and epic interior design (our offices are magical). And having total ownership means I&#x2019;m not pressured by partners, boards or investors to deliver something that I&#x2019;m not passionate about.</p><p>But the climb was hard and long. <em><strong>And I almost lost it all on multiple occasions.</strong></em>&#xA0;I&#x2019;ve made dumb mistakes. I&#x2019;ve had&#xA0;dizzying&#xA0;successes. I&#x2019;ve been depressed and I&#x2019;ve been high.</p><p>Most of all &#x2014; I&#x2019;ve learned and&#xA0;grown. And I want to share some advice.</p><p>If I could advise younger entrepreneurs who are starting out so they avoid the dumb mistakes I made, here&#x2019;s what I would say:</p> <p><strong>1. Your college degree is meaningless (and sometimes a liability).</strong></p><p>I (barely) graduated from the University of Michigan School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. My GPA was just over 2.5. I just could not focus on my engineering classes completely.</p><p>So what did I focus on in university? Volunteer work, traveling and working abroad, pouring through books on business and entrepreneurship, learning photography, and working with theater troupes. I never got good at ONE thing. But having exposure to many different things helped give me an edge as an entrepreneur.</p><p>I think I was lucky to be a&#xA0;mediocre&#xA0;engineer. If I was successful I might be trapped in a 9-to-5 job as an engineer. The best employees are specialists. The best entrepreneurs tend to be generalists.</p> <p>Don&#x2019;t waste your time pursuing a perfect GPA. Instead, embrace the idea of a generalist education. I majored in Computer Engineering and minored in Performing Arts. My best subject was digital photography. And I spent more time volunteering for the local chapter of AIESEC (a foreign work exchange program) than actually studying.</p><p>All, in retrospect, were smart decisions:&#xA0;Having basic knowledge of programming (my programming grades were usually a C) still allowed me to build Mindvalley&#x2019;s early websites myself. Minoring in drama helped me learn stage presence and become a good speaker. Photography gave me an eye for aesthetics and design. &#xA0;And volunteering allowed me to see the world and meet other cultures.</p><p><a class="hidden_link" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/steve-jobs">Steve Jobs</a> said you can&#x2019;t connect the dots looking forward, only backwards. Today it appears that everything I chose to study played a key role in my life and business success.</p><p>Your college degree is meaningless. Your college EXPERIENCE is what matters. Don&#x2019;t waste it pursuing a high GPA at the expense of soaking up everything college life has to offer.</p> <p><strong>2. Don&#x2019;t quit your day job too soon.</strong></p><p>In the early days, quitting your day job is one of the dumbest mistakes I&#x2019;ve seen entrepreneurs make. You&#x2019;re going to need cash flow to survive, to travel, and to buy services like hosting and email solutions. And you won&#x2019;t know how long it will take to get funding or generate cash flow. Unless you&#x2019;ve got cash to live off, sooner or later those funds will run out.</p><p>But the real problem happens when you start worrying about money.&#xA0;Your flow breaks. You start second guessing your ideas. You stay up in bed at night worried about paying the bills.</p><p>Don&#x2019;t quit your day job. It provides security and cash flow till you can break even or get funding. Of course, make sure you have a day job that doesn&#x2019;t require you to work ludicrous hours.</p> <p>If you have a job that you enjoy, it&#x2019;s even dumber to quit cold. The loneliness of striking it out on your own and the boredom of working at home for eight hours a day will get to you. Juggle both till you have cash flow coming in that allows you to survive.</p><p>I started my business on December 22nd, 2002 while still holding a day job. I would work eight-hour days and then come home and put in another two hours on what would eventually become Mindvalley. I only quit my day job in November 2003 when I found myself generating $4,000 a month, which was enough to cover my day-to-day expenses.</p><p>This is important: My first goal was never to make a million dollars. It was simply to generate $4,000 a month, which was the minimum monthly income I needed to survive in New York. I set a minimalistic goal that was within grasp. This took away the pressure. Once I hit this goal, I quit my day job and set a new goal &#x2014; to build a million-dollar-a-year business.</p><p>The early stage between conceiving your idea and generating positive cash flow that&#x2019;s enough to live on is the&#xA0;<em>most</em>&#xA0;crucial stage. Screw this up and you&#x2019;re dead before you begin.</p> <p>People think entrepreneurs are risk takers. That&#x2019;s not completely true. Dumb entrepreneurs take the most risk. Good ones look for safe, sure bets, plan ahead and manage cashflow well.</p><p><strong>3. Business plans are mostly unnecessary.</strong></p><p>My first two companies failed. Both were planned out in detail on business plans. They were tech startups I tried to get funding for in the Valley back when I lived in Mountain View in 2001.</p><p>Yet Mindvalley (at first) had no plan and no vision beyond two years out. It was a simple idea scratched out on a napkin. It was about diving into the pit and selling. I never raised money, never got too complicated. I just hustled.</p> <p>The goal was not&#xA0;<em>millions</em>, nor was it build and flip. It was about figuring out a way to hack together a business that would make me the $4,000 a month I needed to survive so I could quit my day job, marry my girlfriend and then dream up bigger ideas while not having to hold down a 9-to-5. I now cringe every time someone asks me to explain my business plan.</p><p>Instead, every year on January 1st, I borrow my son&#x2019;s color pencils and draw a 5-year diagram of where I want to take the company. I then share this vision with my team and we start hacking our way to it.</p><p>Start with a vision. Preferably, in the words of Joe Vitale: &#x201C;One that SCARES you a little and EXCITES you a lot.&#x201D;</p><p>Then, develop a model to make that vision a reality.&#xA0;Work tirelessly towards building a beta &#x2014; but be prepared to test, pivot and move rapidly as you learn. In the words of <a class="hidden_link" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/steve-blank">Steve Blank</a>: &#x201C;No business plan survives first contact with customers.&#x201D;</p> <p><strong>4. Control your equity.</strong></p><p>I goofed early: I was too generous with equity and ended up giving up half my company. I was unconfident and felt I needed a business partner to make things work. I was so dumb I gave up equity without asking for investment. If I had been smarter, I would have saved on equity and instead created a performance-based bonus scheme.</p><p>I also did not put in a vesting period nor create a shareholders agreement &#x2014; mistakes that cost me close to $5 million dollars.</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, owning the majority of my company is important to me. Having total ownership means I&#x2019;m not pressured by partners, boards or investors to deliver something that I&#x2019;m not passionate about.</p> <p>Take&#xA0;<a href="http://www.awesomenessfest.com/">Awesomeness Fest</a>,&#xA0;for example. It makes absolutely no business sense. It&#x2019;s a huge distraction from making money. And while it&#x2019;s profitable, we give away all our proceeds to charity and made it community-driven. No board would have approved it.</p><p>Money matters. But so does freedom and ownership and having a little fun while running your business.</p><p>Here&#x2019;s what you need to know about ownership:</p><ul><li>Never go 50/50. Always make a list of what each partner is bringing to the table and split accordingly. 50/50 partnerships are done by amateurs.</li><li>Don&#x2019;t just give away a part of your business to a friend just to have a company. Always ask for investment. Make them buy their stake and put their money on the line.</li><li>Use a vesting period: This means that your partner commits to X number of years and only earns the equity upon completing those years. We go for a 5-year vesting period.</li><li>Have a shareholders agreement that stipulates exactly&#xA0;<em>how</em>&#xA0;much to buy back each share when the time comes to part ways (in more cases than not, this&#xA0;<em>will</em>&#xA0;happen). Typically 6x the last 12 month&#x2019;s profit is fair.</li></ul> <p><strong>5. Forge networks and learn to connect.</strong></p><p>I join a lot of networking groups. Much of my inspiration comes from the people I&#x2019;ve met in these groups. I&#x2019;m amazed at how many entrepreneurs suggest that conferences or networking groups are useless. The trick is to get into the right ones.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t join my first group until 2008, five years after I started out. My business exploded as a result. It wasn&#x2019;t just the contacts. It was seeing people&#xA0;<em>already</em>&#xA0;doing the things you dreamed of doing. It made your dreams seem so much easier easy and more possible. I call this the Bannister Effect. Before Roger Bannister ran the four-minute mile, few people thought it was possible. But after he finished, in that same year in the 1930s, dozens of people completed four-minute miles.</p><p>Whether this story is true or not is irrelevant &#x2014; the point is that you can accelerate your business by meeting others who inspire you because they&#x2019;ve already done the things you dream of.</p> <p>Here are the groups I&#x2019;ve joined that have given me amazing value:</p><ol><li><strong>Yanik Silver&#x2019;s Mavericks</strong>: A group of guys that come together a few times a year to do crazy, dangerous things like Halo Skydiving or flying MIGs in Russia. If you have money and a death wish, this is the group for you. More on&#xA0;<a href="http://www.maverick1000.com/">www.Maverick1000.com</a>.</li><li><strong>Joe Polish&#x2019;s 25K</strong>: As the name suggests, I spend the equivalent of an annual college education to be part of this group of entrepreneurs that meets 4-5 times a year for a private mastermind, but Joe is an amazing connector. Through this group I&#x2019;ve met men like <a class="hidden_link" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/richard-branson">Richard Branson</a>, Peter Diamandis and Ray Kurzweil. More on&#xA0;<a href="http://www.geniusnetworkmastermind.com/">www.geniusnetworkmastermind.com</a>.</li><li><strong>Awesomeness Fest</strong>: I started this event to bring together 200 people every year on a paradise location for fun and bonding. No other event I know is as much fun or creates bonds as close as this one.

You must have an existing business.</li></ol><p><strong>6. No other skill is as important as sales and marketing.</strong></p><p>We all have different skills. But there&#x2019;s one skill I feel is most crucial to entrepreneurial success, and it&#x2019;s the ability to&#xA0;<em>sell</em>. I scoffed at the idea of marketing and sales. As a Computer Engineer, my vision of the world was &#x201C;build epic stuff and the crowds will beat a path to your door.&#x201D;</p> <p>Rubbish. <a class="hidden_link" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/tesla">Tesla</a> was an amazing engineer. He ended up broke and depressed as the Engineer-Salesman Edison took his ideas and made them count.</p><p>I failed at my first two businesses too &#x2014; because I was terrible at sales, so I decided I needed a job. But my timing was off &#x2014; it was April 2001. The bubble burst in Silicon Valley: 14,000 people lost their jobs. I was attending pink-slip parties, being sure to buy just one glass of wine (to save cash) and sip it really slowly to make sure it lasted the night.</p><p>No one was hiring so I blasted my resume to every company that was posting a Bay Area job ad on <a class="hidden_link" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/craigslist">Craigslist</a>. I finally got a job at a startup selling technology to law firms. The catch? It was pure sales. If I could not close, I would not get paid. In short, close or starve.</p><p>Ever see the movie &#x201C;Boiler Room?&#x201D; There were days that reminded me of that movie. It was awful work that made it hard to get out of bed in the morning. But boy, did I learn to sell and market. That made ALL the difference.</p> <p>Exactly one year later on December 22nd, 2002 I started Mindvalley. I was profitable by the third month.</p><p>My new edge? Selling.</p><p><strong>7. Don&#x2019;t build crap for the sake of making a buck.</strong></p><p>I believe companies like Coke, McDonalds, etc. were started by entrepreneurs with good intentions but now exist for stockholder value. But are they actually pushing humanity forward?</p> <p>In that famous <a class="hidden_link" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/apple">Apple</a> ad, &#x201C;Here&#x2019;s to the Crazy Ones,&#x201D; Steve Jobs actually contributed just one line. It was, &#x201C;Push humanity forward.&#x201D; That&#x2019;s what real entrepreneurs do. Peter Diamandis is taking mankind to space. Branson adds fun, quality service and cheekiness to old entrenched industries. <a class="hidden_link" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/tony-hsieh">Tony Hsieh</a> &#x201C;delivers happiness.&#x201D; I believe in teaching the world new things that enrich the human potential.</p><p>I&#x2019;m not asking you to dedicate your life to changing the world. I&#x2019;m just asking you to not launch businesses that sell crap, pillage the environment, take advantage of developing nations or like Coke &#x2013; market junk that lead to childhood obesity and other health disasters.</p><p>You don&#x2019;t have to save the world &#x2014; just try not to mess it up for our children.</p><p>Know the difference between and entrepreneur and a businessman? Here&#x2019;s the difference:&#xA0;Business people do it for the dollars.</p> <p>But real entrepreneurs&#xA0;<em>push the human race forward.</em></p><p>Are you?</p><p><em>A version of this post originally appeared <a href="http://www.mindvalleyinsights.com/">on the author&#x2019;s blog</a>.</em></p><p><em>Vishen Lakhiani is the founder of <a href="http://www.mindvalley.com/">Mindvalley</a>.&#xA0;He builds and invests in businesses that are focused on education and personal growth.&#xA0;</em></p> <p><em>The&#xA0;</em><a href="https://theyec.org/"><em>Young Entrepreneur Council (YEC)</em></a><em>&#xA0;is an invite-only nonprofit organization comprised of the world&#x2019;s most promising young entrepreneurs.
