A-Fest is an event designed by Vishen Lakhiani to bring together amazing people from around the world to connect, grow and learn from each other and the world’s best teachers. It takes place in 5-star paradise locations across the world. These events gather an extraordinary community of change-makers and visionaries who are driven by epic ideas to impact the world – entrepreneurs, experts, artists, leaders, innovators, visionaries, and more. A-Fest is like stepping into a different reality of wonder and magic. Since A-Fest is best expressed in visuals and not words, watch the After-Movie of previous events.
The destination and dates for A-Fest 2023 will be announced soon.
