                    "Whenever you look at yourself in the mirror, what do you see? Do you see someone successful and happy? Or do you wish that you were younger and more accomplished?The desire for personal development often roots from a realization or a pressing need for change. And with COVID-19 unsettling our confidence in ourselves making us realize that the world is ever-changing, unpredictable, and uncontrollable, it also elicits unpleasant emotions such as doubt, fear, and frustration. But along with all these challenges lies an opportunity for us to grow as people.Personal development is a continuous process of assessing our skills and improving them. It's a challenge; a daily struggle. There's so little time and so much to do, and it can feel difficult to accomplish even the most basic things like getting a good night's sleep. It can feel like a chore to find time for personal development while juggling with our day-to-day activities.Working from home has changed all of that. Suddenly, we have more time in our hands than we have ever had in the past years.Today is a time to take a step back and work on your personal development; we mean real change and not just some empty promise you tell yourself when you're having a bad day. We mean taking action by investing in Mindvalley's Personal Development Programs.1.
